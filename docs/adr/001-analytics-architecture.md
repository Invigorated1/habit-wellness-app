# ADR-001: Analytics Architecture

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: January 2024  
**Author**: Engineering Team  

## Context

We need a comprehensive analytics system to:
1. Track user behavior and product usage
2. Measure KPIs and business metrics
3. Support A/B testing and experimentation
4. Ensure data privacy and compliance
5. Scale with our growth

Current state:
- Basic PostHog integration for events
- No standardized event taxonomy
- Limited visibility into user journeys
- No experimentation framework

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered analytics architecture:

### 1. Event Taxonomy
- Strict event naming convention: `category.action`
- Centralized event definitions in shared package
- Runtime validation of all events
- Automated documentation generation

### 2. Client-Side Collection
- PostHog for real-time product analytics
- Custom analytics service for event governance
- Batched event sending (30s intervals)
- Session tracking with unique IDs

### 3. Server-Side Processing
- API endpoint for event ingestion
- Event validation and enrichment
- Forward to multiple destinations:
  - PostHog (product analytics)
  - Data warehouse (long-term storage)
  - Sentry (performance monitoring)

### 4. A/B Testing
- Feature flags via PostHog
- Experiment definitions in code
- Automatic variant assignment
- Conversion tracking

### 5. Privacy & Compliance
- User consent management
- PII scrubbing before storage
- GDPR-compliant data retention
- Audit trail for all data access

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Consistent data**: Standardized events across all platforms
- **Reliable metrics**: Validated data ensures accuracy
- **Experimentation**: Easy to run A/B tests
- **Privacy**: Built-in compliance features
- **Scalable**: Can add new destinations easily

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple systems to maintain
- **Learning curve**: Developers must follow taxonomy
- **Cost**: Multiple analytics services
- **Latency**: Batching adds small delay

### Neutral
- **Dependencies**: Reliance on PostHog for features
- **Migration effort**: Existing events need updating
- **Documentation**: Requires ongoing maintenance

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [x] Create event taxonomy in shared package
- [x] Implement analytics service
- [x] Add event validation
- [x] Set up A/B testing framework

### Phase 2: Integration (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Migrate existing events
- [ ] Add server-side endpoint
- [ ] Configure data pipeline
- [ ] Set up monitoring

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] Dashboard creation
- [ ] Team training
- [ ] Documentation

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Google Analytics Only
- **Pros**: Free, widely known
- **Cons**: Limited features, privacy concerns
- **Rejected**: Insufficient for our needs

### 2. Build Custom Solution
- **Pros**: Full control, no vendor lock-in
- **Cons**: High maintenance, long development
- **Rejected**: Not core competency

### 3. Single Vendor (Segment)
- **Pros**: One integration, many destinations
- **Cons**: Expensive, less flexibility
- **Rejected**: Cost prohibitive at scale
