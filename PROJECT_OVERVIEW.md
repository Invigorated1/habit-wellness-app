# 📱 Habit Wellness App - Project Overview

## 🎯 What Is This Project?

This is a **habit tracking web application** - think of it like a digital journal where users can:
- Create personal habits they want to track (like "Exercise daily" or "Read for 30 minutes")
- Mark habits as complete each day
- See their progress and streaks over time
- Access their data from any device

### 🔧 Tech Stack Explained

**Frontend (What Users See)**
- **Next.js 15**: The framework that builds your website - like the foundation of a house
- **React 19**: Makes the website interactive - like adding doors and windows that open/close
- **TailwindCSS v4**: Makes everything look pretty - like paint and decorations

**Backend (Behind the Scenes)**
- **API Routes**: The messengers that handle requests - like waiters in a restaurant
- **Prisma**: Talks to your database - like a translator between your app and database
- **PostgreSQL (Neon)**: Stores all the data - like a filing cabinet for user information

**Authentication (Security)**
- **Clerk**: Handles user login/signup - like a security guard checking IDs at the door
- **Middleware**: Protects private pages - like locks on certain rooms

## 📊 Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Already Built

1. **Authentication System** (Complete)
   - Users can sign up with email or Google
   - Users can log in securely
   - Only logged-in users can see their habits

2. **Database Foundation** (Complete)
   - User profiles are stored
   - Habits are saved permanently
   - Everything is connected properly

3. **API Endpoints** (Complete)
   - Create new habits
   - View all habits
   - Update existing habits
   - Delete habits

4. **Basic Dashboard** (Partial)
   - Shows list of habits
   - Displays basic information
   - Real-time data updates

### 🚧 What Still Needs Building

1. **User Interface Components**
   - Forms to create new habits
   - Buttons to edit/delete habits
   - Checkboxes to mark habits complete

2. **Daily Tracking**
   - Mark habits as done today
   - Track completion history
   - Calculate streaks automatically

3. **Visual Improvements**
   - Better looking dashboard
   - Progress charts
   - Mobile-friendly design

4. **Home Page**
   - Welcome page for new visitors
   - Information about the app
   - Call-to-action buttons

## 🗄️ Database Structure (How Data is Organized)

Think of it like a filing system:

```
Users Cabinet
├── User File #1
│   ├── Name: John Doe
│   ├── Email: john@example.com
│   └── Habits Folder
│       ├── Habit: "Morning Meditation"
│       │   ├── Description: "10 minutes daily"
│       │   ├── Streak: 5 days
│       │   └── Completion Records
│       │       ├── Jan 1: ✓ Completed
│       │       ├── Jan 2: ✓ Completed
│       │       └── Jan 3: ✗ Missed
│       └── Habit: "Exercise"
└── User File #2
    └── ... (similar structure)
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Route Protection**: Some pages require login - like needing a key to enter certain rooms
2. **User Isolation**: Users only see their own data - like having separate lockers
3. **Secure Authentication**: Handled by Clerk (a trusted service) - like using a professional locksmith

## 🛠️ Development Setup

To work on this project, developers need:
1. **Environment Variables**: Secret keys and passwords stored in `.env` file
2. **Database Connection**: Link to PostgreSQL database
3. **Node.js & pnpm**: Tools to run the code
4. **Clerk Account**: For authentication services

## 📈 Scalability & Future-Proofing

The app is built to grow:
- **Monorepo Structure**: Can add mobile apps later
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents bugs
- **Modern Stack**: Using latest, stable technologies
- **Cloud Database**: Can handle many users

## 🎮 How It All Works Together

1. **User visits website** → Next.js serves the pages
2. **User signs up** → Clerk handles authentication
3. **User creates habit** → API endpoint receives request
4. **API saves to database** → Prisma translates to SQL
5. **Database stores data** → PostgreSQL keeps it safe
6. **Dashboard updates** → SWR fetches new data
7. **User sees their habits** → React displays the UI

## 💡 Key Concepts for Non-Technical People

- **API**: Like a waiter taking your order to the kitchen
- **Database**: Like a filing cabinet storing information
- **Frontend**: What you see on screen (like a store window)
- **Backend**: What happens behind the scenes (like the warehouse)
- **Authentication**: Proving who you are (like showing ID)
- **Middleware**: Rules that run before showing pages (like a bouncer)

## 🚀 Getting to MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

To have a working app that users can actually use, we need:
1. ✅ Users can sign up and log in
2. ✅ Users can create habits
3. ⏳ Users can mark habits as complete daily
4. ⏳ Users can see their progress
5. ⏳ Nice looking, easy-to-use interface

**Progress: About 60% complete** - The foundation is solid, now we need the user-facing features!
